## Introduction
Azure Cosmos DB Core (SQL) API provides **Indexing Metrics** to show both utilized indexed paths and recommended indexed paths. As an Azure Cosmos DB developer, you can leverage these Core (SQL) API indexing metrics to optimize query performance.

## Points to Note
3 important points to note:
1. Indexing Metrics is especially useful in cases where you are not sure how to modify the indexing policy for your specific use-case and Query Patterns.
2. Indexing Metrics is available for usage in Azure Cosmos DB .NET SDK and Java SDK, as of now.
3. Indexing Metrics require a minimum version: 1) If you're on .NET SDK, you need to ensure you're using .NET SDK ver 3.21.0 or later, 2) If you're on Java SDK, you need to ensure you're using 4.19.0 or later.

## How to Enable Indexing Metrics
You can enable indexing metrics for a query by setting the PopulateIndexMetrics property to true. When not specified, PopulateIndexMetrics defaults to false. 

## An Example in .NET SDK
I have an Azure Cosmos DB database named 'NutritionDatabase' and container named 'FoodCollection'.
You can see a sample schema of the items in the container.

The default Indexing Policy set at the container level is exhibited below.

I need to execute the following query:
```
SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.foodGroup = 'Baby Foods' and IS_DEFINED(c.description) and IS_DEFINED(c.manufacturerName) ORDER BY c.tags.name ASC, c.version ASC
```

Since I need to execute an ORDER BY query, we need to creat a Composite Index directly in the Azure por
Hence, I go and change the Indexing Policy accordingly.

```
{
    "indexingMode": "consistent",
    "automatic": true,
    "includedPaths": [
        {
            "path": "/foodGroup/*"
        },
        {
            "path": "/manufacturerName/*"
        },
        {
            "path": "/tags/[]/name/*"
        },
        {
            "path": "/version/*"
        }
    ],
    "excludedPaths": [
        {
            "path": "/*"
        },
        {
            "path": "/\"_etag\"/?"
        }
    ],
    "compositeIndexes": [
        [
            {
                "path": "/tags/name",
                "order": "ascending"
            },
            {
                "path": "/version",
                "order": "ascending"
            }
        ]
    ]
}
```
From the Azure portal, we get an output similar to as exhibited below.

As a next step, we can leverage either the .NET or Java SDK to understand the both the utilized indexed paths and recommended indexed paths.

E.g., I am using the .NET SDK ver 3.26.1.
In the below code, you need to enable indexing metrics for a specific query by setting the **PopulateIndexMetrics** property to true.

```
    // In-partition Query: Complex
        string sqlQueryText = "SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.foodGroup = 'Baby Foods' and IS_DEFINED(c.description) and IS_DEFINED(c.manufacturerName) ORDER BY c.tags.name ASC, c.version ASC";
        QueryDefinition query = new QueryDefinition(sqlQueryText);
        FeedIterator<Food> resultSetIterator = container.GetItemQueryIterator<Food>(query, requestOptions: new QueryRequestOptions { PopulateIndexMetrics = true });
        FeedResponse<Food> response = null;
        while (resultSetIterator.HasMoreResults)
        {
            response = await resultSetIterator.ReadNextAsync();
            Console.WriteLine(response.IndexMetrics);
        }

        FeedResponse<Food> queryResponse3 = await resultSetIterator.ReadNextAsync();
        await Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($"Query is: {sqlQueryText}");
        await Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($"{response.RequestCharge} RUs");
        Console.Out.WriteLine();
```
Check the output as exhibited below.

The output is divided into 4 key sections:
1) Utilized Single Indexes
2) Potential Single Indexes
3) Utilized Composite Indexes
4) Potential Composite Indexes

The index **impact score** is the likelihood that an indexed path, based on the query shape, has a significant impact on query performance. In other words, the index impact score is the probability that, without that specific indexed path, the query RU charge would have been substantially higher. There are two possible index impact scores: high and low. If you have multiple potential indexed paths, we recommend focusing on indexed paths with a high impact score.

```
Index Spec: /foodGroup/?
Index Impact Score: High
```
means, /foodGroup which is the partitionKey for the container and part of the query, and indexing policy is important for the correct working of the query. In other words, the index impact score is the probability that, without that specific indexed path, the query RU charge would have been substantially higher.

```
Index Spec: /manufacturerName/?
Index Impact Score: Low
```
means, /manufacturerName though is part of the query, but has a low impact on the overall indexing both in terms of performance & query RU charge.

```
Index Spec: /description/?
Index Impact Score: Low
```
means, /description which is a potential Single Index, but has low impact on the overall scheme of things.
```
Index Spec: /tags/name ASC, /version ASC
Index Impact Score: High
```
means, /tags/name ASC, /version ASC which form our Utilized Composite Indexes are key for high performance and lowering overall RU cost.
